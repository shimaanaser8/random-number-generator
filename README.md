## Modeling RNG Project

This is a C++ object-oriented project that implements several Random Number Generators (RNGs) and allows users to input their own parameters. The project includes:

- **Inversive Congruential Generator (ICG)** with Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test for randomness.  
- **Multiple Recursive Generator (MRG)**  
- **Lagged Fibonacci Generator (LFG)**  
- **Mid-Square Method (MSM)**

Users can generate sequences and test their randomness interactively.

## Features
- Fully object-oriented design.
- User can enter custom values instead of fixed parameters.
- Implements standard RNG algorithms for simulation and modeling purposes.
- Includes statistical testing (KS test) for ICG sequences.
